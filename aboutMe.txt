I am a civil engineer and recent MBA grad living near Vancouver, BC, Canada. I like to travel and am interested in sustainability principles. I'm into bartering and making beer. I'm not sure what my favourite book is...I guess I like poetry by Rumi and most short stories by Ray Bradbury (especially the Illustrated man).
