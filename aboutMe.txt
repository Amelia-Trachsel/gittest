I am a civil engineer and recent MBA grad living near Vancouver, BC, Canada. I like to travel and am interested in sustainability principles. I'm into bartering, burlesque and making beer. I traveled through the Northwest Passage on a Students on Ice expedition this summer. I'm not sure if I could pick a favourite movie, but I like the original Blade Runner. I have a job interview tomorrow which will require a relocation to Iqaluit.
